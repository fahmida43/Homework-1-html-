        <p style="color: rgb(92, 15, 15);"><mark>Critical thinking</mark> has always been emphasised heavily in education and with good reason. It is known to improve creativity,
             foster curiosity and enhance decision-making. Another benefit of mastering this ability is that it's universally relevant across
              all professions and fields.<br>Being a critical thinker has ramifications outside of academic and professional surroundings as well.
               It's easier than ever for fake news to spread and more than a little difficult to determine what is correct, given the overwhelming number 
               of information sources. The amount of misinformation circulating around the pandemic should serve as an eye-opener in this regard.

        <p style="color: rgb(56, 8, 8);">There has been constant debate about whether the quality of our national education is up to par with global standards, as well as attempts to reinvent it. Thankfully, the NCTB has been going through a much-needed overhaul, starting from 2022.

            Here's a little recap: in the revised framework, there will be no public exams before class 10 and no 
            exams of any kind for students up to class 3. SSC exams will consist of five subjects, while HSC will be 
            held in two phases. The division of science, humanities and business studies will occur from class 11 
            instead of 9. All these revisions 
            are reportedly devised to facilitate holistic learning and improve creativity and competence.</p>
